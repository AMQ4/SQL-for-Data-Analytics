One day, your manager at ZoomZoom calls you in and tells you that the marketing department has decided that they want to do a series of
marketing campaigns to help promote a sale. You will need to send queries to the manager to pull the data. The following are the steps to
complete the activity:
	1. Open your favorite SQL client and connect to the sqlda database. Examine the schema for the customers table from the
	   schema dropdown.
	2. Write a query that pulls all emails for ZoomZoom customers in the state of Florida in alphabetical order.
	3. Write a query that pulls all the first names, last names and email details for ZoomZoom customers in New York City in the state of
	   New York. They should be ordered alphabetically by the last name followed by the first name.
	4. Write a query that returns all customers with a phone number ordered by the date the customer was added to the database.
