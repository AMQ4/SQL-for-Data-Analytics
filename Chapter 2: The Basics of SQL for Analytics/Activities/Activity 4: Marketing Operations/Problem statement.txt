You did a great job pulling data for the marketing team. However, the marketing manager, who you so graciously helped, realized that
they had made a mistake. It turns out that instead of just the query, the manager needs to create a new table in the company's analytics
database. Furthermore, they need to make some changes to the data that is present in the customers table.It is your job to help the
marketing manager with the table:
1. Create a new table called customers_nyc that pulls all rows from the customers table where the customer lives in New York
City in the state of New York.
2. Delete from the new table all customers in postal code 10014. Due to local laws, they will not be eligible for marketing.
3. Add a new text column called event.
4. Set the value of the event to thank-you party.
