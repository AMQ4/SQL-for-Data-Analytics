The aim of this activity is to clean and prepare our data for analysis using SQL techniques. The data science team wants to build a new model to help predict which customers 
are the best prospects for remarketing. A new data scientist has joined their team anddoes not know the database well enough to pull a dataset for this new model. 
The responsibility has fallen to you to help the new data scientist prepare and build a dataset to be used to train a model. 
Write a query to assemble a dataset that will do the following:
1. Open a SQL client and connect to the database.
2. Use INNER JOIN to join the customers table to the sales table.
3. Use INNER JOIN to join the products table to the sales table.
4. Use LEFT JOIN to join the dealerships table to the sales table.
5. Now, return all columns of the customers table and the products table.
6. Then, return the dealership_id column from the sales table, but fill in dealership_id in sales with -1 if it is NULL.
7. Add a column called high_savings that returns 1 if the sales amount was 500 less than base_msrp or lower.
Otherwise, it returns 0.
