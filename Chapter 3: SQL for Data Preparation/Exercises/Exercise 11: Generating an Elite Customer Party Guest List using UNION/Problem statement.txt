In this exercise, we will assemble two queries using unions. In order to help build up marketing awareness for the new Model Chi,
the marketing team would like to throw a party for some of ZoomZoom's wealthiest customers in Los Angeles, CA. To help
facilitate the party, they would like you to make a guest list with ZoomZoom customers who live in Los Angeles, CA, as well as
salespeople who work at the ZoomZoom dealership in Los Angeles, CA. The guest list should include the first name, the last name,
and whether the guest is a customer or an employee.
