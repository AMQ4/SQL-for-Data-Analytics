The aim is to create a query that will map various values in a column to other values. The head of sales has an idea to try and create
specialized regional sales teams that will be able to sell scooters to customers in specific regions, as opposed to generic sales teams.
To make his idea a reality, he would like a list of all customers mapped to regions. For customers from the states of MA, NH, VT,
ME CT, or RI, he would like them labeled as New England. For customers from the states of GA, FL, MS, AL, LA, KY, VA, NC,
SC, TN, VI, WV, or AR, he would like the customers labeled as Southeast. Customers from any other state should be labeled as
Other.
